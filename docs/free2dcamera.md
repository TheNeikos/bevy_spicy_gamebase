# `Free2DCamera`

The `Free2DCamera` allows you to move the camera with keyboard inputs as well as the mouse.
In the same vein, it also allows scrolling through the `.with_scale_range` method.
If one wishes to have bound limits then `.with_limits` allows to specify (in pixel) the bounds
of a camera in world space.
