# Game Design Document

The "Bevy Spicy Gamebase" game (or BSG) is a jump and run game, inspired by old-school classics but with
its own unique spin.

to the exit. This is made more difficult as different seeds have different constraints placed on them.

## Mechanics

- The player can walk left/right and jump.

  - Each seed has a different effect on the player
  - TODO: Enumerate the different ones
