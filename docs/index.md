# Documentation

This is the starting page for my awesome documentation for "Bevy Spicy Gamebase".

If you are using this gamebase, take a look at the documentation contained in this folder
and adapt/update it as you make it your own game.

## Game Overview

The game included in this gamebase is a simple jump and run with a catch. You are creature
that loves plants, but you are trapped in cyberspace. Your objective is to carry the seeds
you find to the exit, in hopes of being able to escape to a natural environment.

## Docs Overview

"Bevy Spicy Gamebase" is itself already a game. It is a simple jump and run, from which
you can iterate to make your own games. Or you could remove it all and just keep the bare bones.

This documentation is split up into multiple parts, the first, and arguably the most important
is the _game design document_. There you can read all about how the game is meant to be played
and supposed to look and feel like. Then there is a technical overview, giving any newcomers an
overview of what exists in the source.
